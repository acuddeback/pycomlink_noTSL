This repository contains the code for a final project from ASEN 5245 at CU Boulder. This notebook is based on the [Basic CML Proecssing Workflow](https://github.com/pycomlink/pycomlink/blob/master/notebooks/Basic%20CML%20processing%20workflow.ipynb) from the [pycomlink](https://github.com/pycomlink/pycomlink) repository, and demonstrates calculating rain rate without the use of transmitted signal level.
